      <p>
        There are currently multiple solutions for ruby on the Web. They are not compatible. The
        XHTML model is not used much and can largely be ignored, but the current HTML5 model,
        despite shortcomings, may be used (to be verified) and therefore constrain the HTML5
        extended model that has been developed in the meantime. Further, there is ongoing work
        on <a href='http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-ruby/'>CSS Ruby</a> with which we need strict
        alignment if the system is going to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to serve as a workspace in which to hammer out a unified model
        that can be backwards compatible with whatever genuine content is used in the wild while
        enabling the known use cases or at least making it possible to extend the markup in such a
        way that they can be supported in the future.

        This specification is a proposed extension specification to HTML and has no official
        standing whatsoever.

      XXX
        - look at corpus
        - look at EPUB spec for ruby
        - start from model proposed in CSS Ruby, see if it is sufficient and complement if not
        - if compatibility is required, then take the existing HTML5 markup and re-describe it in
          terms of that model
        - then for each use case that is not covered in the current HTML5 model, figure out a way
          to add support for it that fits into the syntax
        - rewrite the algorithm
